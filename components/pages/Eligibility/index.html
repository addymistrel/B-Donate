          <b><u>Blood Donation Requirements</u></b>
        </h1>
        <p id="p1">
          You may be wondering if you can donate blood. Donating blood is safe
          and easy to do, but there are a few basic requirements to donate
          blood. If you're in good health and meet the general eligibility blood
          donation requirements, then you are likely able to give blood.
        </p>

        <p id="p2">
          <strong>Why are there requirements to donate blood?</strong>
          Eligibility requirements are important to help ensure the safety of
          both the blood donor and blood recipient. The Food and Drug
          Administration (FDA) has established blood donation requirements to
          keep the blood supply safe from bloodborne diseases and also keep
          patients safe from anything in a donor's blood (such as a medication)
          that could harm them. These blood donation requirements also protect
          donors by making sure they are physically able to safely donate.
        </p>

        <p id="p3">
          Blood donations save lives every day, and donors are needed every
          day.<u
            ><b
              >About 62 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate at
              any one time but only 3 percent do so</b
            ></u
          >. If you don't meet the blood donation requirements today or receive
          a deferral, we encourage you to come back and check again. You will
          likely be eligible to donate blood in the future and the need for
          blood never stops.

            Unlike plasma that is donated specifically for patient transfusion,
            source plasma is collected and used to develop lifesaving medicines
            and therapies for patients with neurological disorders, immune
            deficiencies, bleeding disorders and more. Currently, Vitalant only
            offers voluntary source plasma donation opportunities to people who
            live in the Sacramento area.
