          <div class="content__description" aria-label="Page Description Body">
            <p>You may be wondering if you can donate blood. Donating blood is safe and easy to do, but there are a few basic requirements to donate blood. If you&#39;re in good health and meet the general eligibility blood donation requirements, then you are likely able to give blood. .</p>

             <p><strong>Why are there requirements to donate blood?</strong> Eligibility requirements are important to help ensure the safety of both the blood donor and blood recipient. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established blood donation requirements to keep the blood supply safe from bloodborne diseases and also keep patients safe from anything in a donor&rsquo;s blood (such as a medication) that could harm them. These blood donation requirements also protect donors by making sure they are physically able to safely donate.</p>

             <p>Blood donations save lives every day, and donors are needed every day. <u><b>About 62 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate at any one time but only 3 percent do so</u></b></p>. If you don&rsquo;t meet the blood donation requirements today or receive a deferral, we encourage you to come back and check again. You will likely be eligible to donate blood in the future and the need for blood never stops.</p>

                    Requirements for source plasma
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Unlike plasma that is donated specifically for patient transfusion, source plasma is collected and used to develop lifesaving medicines and therapies for patients with neurological disorders, immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders and more. Currently, Vitalant only offers voluntary source plasma donation opportunities to people who live in the Sacramento area.
