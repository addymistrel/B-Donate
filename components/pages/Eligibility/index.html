            <h1>Blood Donation Requirements</h1>
            <p id="p1">
              You may be wondering if you can donate blood. Donating blood is
              safe and easy to do, but there are a few basic requirements to
              donate blood.
            </p>

            <p id="p2">
              <strong>Why are there requirements to donate blood?</strong>
              Eligibility requirements are important to help ensure the safety
              of both the blood donor and blood recipient.
            </p>

            <p id="p3">
              Blood donations save lives every day, and donors are needed every

            <ul>
              <li>
                Must be at least 16 years old (16- and some 17-year-olds must
                bring a signed permission form from a parent or guardian, if
                required by state or school).
              </li>
              <li>
                Weigh at least 110 pounds. Certain height/weight criteria may
                apply for donors 22 years old or younger. For specific
                requirements in your area, please call 877-258-4825.

              <li>Be in good general health.</li>
              <li>
                For your safety and to ensure a positive donation experience,
                make sure you eat within two hours ahead of your donation. Drink
                plenty of water that day and 24 to 48 hours beforehand. Feel
                free to help yourself to something to eat and drink in our
                refreshment area.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bring your IDâ€”something with your name and one of the following:
                date of birth, donor ID number or your photo.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must wait eight weeks between whole blood donations. Learn
                more about specific intervals for other types of donation.
              </li>
              <li>
                You should not be under the influence of alcohol or recreational

            <p>
              Platelet donors should avoid aspirin and/or aspirin-containing
              products 48 hours prior to donation and other anti-platelet
              medications.

            <summary>Requirements for source plasma.</summary>
            <p>
              Unlike plasma that is donated specifically for patient
              transfusion, source plasma is collected and used to develop
              lifesaving medicines and therapies for patients with neurological
              disorders, immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders and more.
              Currently, Vitalant only offers voluntary source plasma donation
              opportunities to people who live in the Sacramento area.
